This is the **Angular frontend** for the **Employee Tax Calculator** project, implemented using an **Nx monorepo**. The app calculates UK income tax based on salary bands and provides a breakdown of gross, tax, and net salary per employee.

## Monorepo Structure

The application is split into modular libraries to support enterprise-scale architecture:

| Library                          | Purpose                                          |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `@employee-tax/data-access`      | Handles API communication, DTOs, and interfaces  |
| `@employee-tax/employee-list`    | Feature lib to display all employees             |
| `@employee-tax/employee-details` | Feature lib to display & update employee details |
| `@employee-tax/components`       | Shared components library (e.g., tables)         |

---

## State Management

Implemented using **NgRx Signal Store** for efficient and reactive state management:

- `EmployeeListStore`: Loads and manages the list of employees.
- `EmployeeDetailsStore`: Fetches and updates a single employee's salary data.

Both stores use Angular Signals, computed properties, and are co-located with their respective feature libraries for modularity.
